# Hello Typescript

### What is it?

A bit like a fancy linter. Syntactic superset of javascript that compiles to JS.

3 parts:

- language
- language server
- compiler

### Benefits

Move errors that would occur at runtime to compile time eg:

- `null` / `undefned` values
- incomplete refactoring work
- broken internal code contracts (function args becoming required)

Also improved editor experience with code completion etc
